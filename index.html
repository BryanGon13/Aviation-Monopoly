            <b>1916<br>Boeing is founded</b>
          </h3>
          <hr>
          <p class="milestone-text">
            On the 15th of July 1916, William Boeing, an enterprising American
            aviator, established the Pacific Aero Products Company in Seattle,
            Washington. The following year, the company introduced its inaugural
            aircraft, the Boeing Model 1, also known as the Boeing B&W. This
            aircraft was a two-seat, single-engine biplane seaplane, primarily
            designed for training and reconnaissance missions.<br>
            This launch heralded the start of Boeing’s journey as an aircraft
            manufacturer. When the United States entered World War I in 1917,
            the company, now renamed Boeing Airplane Company, quickly adapted to
            support the war effort by producing military aircraft. After the
            conflict ended, Boeing pivoted towards the rapidly expanding
            commercial aviation sector, focusing on the development and
            production of aircraft to serve the growing demands of commercial
            airlines.<br>
            This strategic shift set the foundation for Boeing's long-term
            presence in the aviation industry.

          <p class="milestone-text">
            On May 18, 1969, Airbus Industrie was established as a
            groundbreaking consortium of European aerospace companies, marking a
            pivotal moment in the history of commercial aviation. This historic
            collaboration brought together leading aerospace manufacturers from
            France, Germany, Spain, and the United Kingdom with the shared
            vision of creating a competitive and innovative European aircraft
            manufacturer.<br>
            The founding members of Airbus Industrie included notable companies
            such as Aerospatiale (France), Deutsche Airbus (Germany), Hawker
            Siddeley (UK), and Construcciones Aeronáuticas SA (Spain), among
            others.<br>
            By pooling their resources and expertise, the founding members of
            Airbus Industrie aimed to challenge the dominance of established
            American aerospace manufacturers, particularly Boeing, in the global
            commercial aviation market.<br>
            The creation of Airbus signaled Europe's ambition to become a major
            player in the aerospace industry and to assert its technological and
            industrial capabilities on the world stage.
