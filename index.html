                <h3>Boeing is founded</h3>
                <p>On the 15th of July 1916, William Boeing, an American entrepreneur and aviator, founded the Pacific Aero Products Company in Seattle, Washington. 
                 In 1917, the company's first aircraft, the Boeing Model 1, also known as the Boeing B&W, made its debut. It was a two-seat, single-engine biplane seaplane designed for training and reconnaissance purposes. This marked the beginning of Boeing's legacy as an aircraft manufacturer.
                <br>As the United States entered World War I in 1917, Boeing Airplane Company, as it was renamed that year, began producing military aircraft for the war effort. After the war, Boeing shifted its focus to commercial aviation, developing and manufacturing aircraft for the burgeoning commercial airline industry.</p>

                <h3>Airbus is formed</h3>
                <p>On May 18, 1969, Airbus Industrie was established as a groundbreaking consortium of European aerospace companies, marking a pivotal moment in the history of commercial aviation. This historic collaboration brought together leading aerospace manufacturers from France, Germany, Spain, and the United Kingdom with the shared vision of creating a competitive and innovative European aircraft manufacturer.
                    The founding members of Airbus Industrie included notable companies such as Aerospatiale (France), Deutsche Airbus (Germany), Hawker Siddeley (UK), and Construcciones Aeron√°uticas SA (Spain), among others.
                    By pooling their resources and expertise, the founding members of Airbus Industrie aimed to challenge the dominance of established American aerospace manufacturers, particularly Boeing, in the global commercial aviation market. The creation of Airbus signaled Europe's ambition to become a major player in the aerospace industry and to assert its technological and industrial capabilities on the world stage.
