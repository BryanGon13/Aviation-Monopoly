            <b>1916<br>Boeing is founded</b>
          </h2>
          <hr>
          <p class="milestone-text">
            On the 15th of July 1916, William Boeing, an enterprising American
            aviator, established the Pacific Aero Products Company in Seattle,
            Washington. The following year, the company introduced its inaugural
            aircraft, the Boeing Model 1, also known as the Boeing B&W. This
            aircraft was a two-seat, single-engine biplane seaplane, primarily
            designed for training and reconnaissance missions.<br>
            This launch heralded the start of Boeing’s journey as an aircraft
            manufacturer. When the United States entered World War I in 1917,
            the company, now renamed Boeing Airplane Company, quickly adapted to
            support the war effort by producing military aircraft. After the
            conflict ended, Boeing pivoted towards the rapidly expanding
            commercial aviation sector, focusing on the development and
            production of aircraft to serve the growing demands of commercial
            airlines.<br>
            This strategic shift set the foundation for Boeing's long-term
            presence in the aviation industry.

              history</b>
          </h2>
          <hr>
          <p class="milestone-text">
            On the 9th of April 1967, the Boeing 737, one of the most iconic and
            successful commercial jetliners in history, took to the skies for
            its maiden flight, marking a significant milestone in aviation.
            Designed to meet the growing demand for short to medium-haul air
            travel, the Boeing 737 was poised to become a game-changer in the
            airline industry.<br>
            The Boeing 737 quickly gained popularity among airlines worldwide
            due to its fuel efficiency, operational flexibility, and passenger
            comfort. Over the years, it underwent several iterations and
            upgrades, evolving into various models to meet changing market
            demands and technological advancements.
            <br>With its unparalleled success and longevity, the Boeing 737
            has cemented its status as the best-selling commercial jetliner in
            history. <br>
            It has played a pivotal role in shaping the modern airline industry,
            serving as a workhorse for airlines around the globe and connecting

            <b>1969<br>Airbus is formed</b>
          </h2>
          <hr>
          <p class="milestone-text">
            On May 18, 1969, Airbus Industrie was established as a
            groundbreaking consortium of European aerospace companies, marking a
            pivotal moment in the history of commercial aviation. This historic
            collaboration brought together leading aerospace manufacturers from
            France, Germany, Spain, and the United Kingdom with the shared
            vision of creating a competitive and innovative European aircraft
            manufacturer.<br>
            The founding members of Airbus Industrie included notable companies
            such as Aerospatiale (France), Deutsche Airbus (Germany), Hawker
            Siddeley (UK), and Construcciones Aeronáuticas SA (Spain), among
            others.<br>
            By pooling their resources and expertise, the founding members of
            Airbus Industrie aimed to challenge the dominance of established
            American aerospace manufacturers, particularly Boeing, in the global
            commercial aviation market.<br>
            The creation of Airbus signaled Europe's ambition to become a major
            player in the aerospace industry and to assert its technological and
            industrial capabilities on the world stage.

          </h2>
          <hr>
          <p class="milestone-text">
            On June 26, 1983, Airbus introduced the groundbreaking Airbus A320,
            marking a pivotal moment in aviation history as the world's first
            fly-by-wire commercial aircraft. Departing from traditional
            mechanical controls, the A320 incorporated advanced fly-by-wire
            technology, utilizing electronic signals to transmit pilot commands.
            This innovation revolutionized aircraft control, offering pilots
            enhanced precision, responsiveness, and safety. With its fly-by-wire
            system, the A320 boasted improved stability, maneuverability, and
            flight envelope protection features, ensuring optimal performance
            while reducing the risk of accidents.
            <br>Moreover, the A320's advanced avionics and automation
            simplified cockpit operations, minimizing pilot workload and
            enhancing overall flight safety.<br>
            This user-friendly design not only increased operational efficiency
            but also set a new standard for cockpit technology in commercial
            aviation. In summary, the introduction of the Airbus A320
            represented a monumental leap forward in aviation technology,
            showcasing Airbus's commitment to innovation and safety. Its
            pioneering use of fly-by-wire technology revolutionized aircraft
            design and performance, shaping the future of commercial aviation.
