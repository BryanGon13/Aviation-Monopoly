## Design

### Imagery
The visuals featured on the Aviation Monopoly website play a crucial role in enhancing the user's overall experience. We maintain a clean and academic white background, providing a canvas for various sections distinguished by different shades of green. This deliberate choice not only ensures visual clarity but also adds a touch of sophistication, contributing to a seamless and engaging browsing experience for our users.

### Colours
The colour scheme of the website is white with varying shades of green used to tie in pictures of aircrafts. A dark grey font is used which has a good contrast with the light green and white backgrounds making it easy to read. 

### Fonts
The Roboto font is the main font used throughout the whole website. This font was imported via [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/). I'm using Sans Serif as a backup font, in case for any reason the main font isn't being imported into the site correctly.

## Wireframes
