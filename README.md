## Design

### Imagery
The visuals featured on the Aviation Monopoly website play a crucial role in enhancing the user's overall experience. We maintain a clean and academic white background, providing a canvas for various sections distinguished by different shades of green. This deliberate choice not only ensures visual clarity but also adds a touch of sophistication, contributing to a seamless and engaging browsing experience for our users.

### Colours
The colour scheme of the website is white with varying shades of green used to tie in pictures of aircrafts. A dark grey font is used which has a good contrast with the light green and white backgrounds making it easy to read. 

### Fonts
The Roboto font is the main font used throughout the whole website. This font was imported via [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/). I'm using Sans Serif as a backup font, in case for any reason the main font isn't being imported into the site correctly.

## Wireframes
Wireframes were produced using Balsamiq.

- I also used the following websites to test responsiveness:
    - [Responsinator](http://www.responsinator.com/?url=bryangon13.github.io%2FAviation-Monopoly%2F)
    - [Am I Responsive](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive?url=https://bryangon13.github.io/Aviation-Monopoly/)

### Friends and Family User Testing

Friends and family members were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.

## Fixed Bugs

### Anchor link scroll with a fixed position header

- The header element contains anchor links to allow the user to navigate to different sections within the website. By default, these will scroll so that the target element is flush with the top of the browser window.
- When I updated the header to use a fixed top position, the beginning of each section ended up being covered by the header, which wasn’t ideal.
- To resolve the issue I changed the position from fixed to relative. This way, when the user clicks on a nav link, the browser window scrolls to the top of the corresponding section. 

### Anchor links broken 

- Anchor links (Airbus and Boeing) malfunctioned, failing to redirect to the correct pages upon clicking.
-  ⁠Difficulty encountered in linking separate pages (Airbus and Boeing) to the respective a tags due to limitation of linking only elements within the same page.
- ⁠Successfully implemented linking between index.html and distinct web pages, enabling navigation functionality; resolved by duplicating and integrating the header across all pages for consistency.
